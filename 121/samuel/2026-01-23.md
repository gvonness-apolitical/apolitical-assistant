## Opening (2 min)

"Thanks for making time, Samuel. It's been about a week since our conversation on the 14th. I want to check in on how things are going and give you some feedback on what I've observed."

---

## Acknowledging Progress (5 min)

"I want to start by recognizing the work you've done since our last conversation:

1. **PLA-221 completed** - Getting the secret manager working locally is done.

2. **GKE Audit RFC** - This is comprehensive. The analysis of 9 pain points, the trade-off evaluation of 3 approaches, and the incremental hardening recommendation shows senior-level thinking. This is exactly the kind of depth I want to see.

3. **PR activity has picked up:**
   - Two PRs raised (GSM integration and Snyk fix)
   - Two PR reviews given

4. **Quality of your reviews is good** - On PR #6041, you raised a thoughtful point about deletion order and partial failure states. On #6109, you correctly identified that explicit feature flags are better than relying on NODE_ENV. These comments show architectural awareness."

---

## Concerns to Address (5 min)

"However, I still have some concerns:

1. **PR reviews on track** - 2 reviews this week meets expectations. Keep this pace up.

2. **PLA-220 is still blocked** - This token rotation investigation has been blocked for too long. What's the specific blocker?

3. **Both your PRs are still in draft** - PR #6068 has been open since Jan 16. PR #6130 since Jan 20. What's keeping these from being ready for review?"

---

## Setting Expectations (3 min)

"To be clear about what success looks like over the next 2-3 weeks:

1. **Maintain 2-3 PR reviews per week** - You hit this target this week. Keep it up.

2. **Unblock PLA-220** - Either resolve the blocker or escalate it. Tickets shouldn't stay blocked indefinitely.

3. **Get your PRs out of draft** - Move #6068 and #6130 to ready-for-review status.

4. **Daily standups or async updates** - I need visibility into what you're working on and any blockers.

5. **Complete at least one more ticket** - PLA-316 or PLA-320 should be moving forward."

---

## The Question

"Samuel, you've shown you can do thoughtful work - the GKE RFC and your review comments prove that. But the pace and consistency isn't there yet. What do you need from me to help you hit these targets consistently?"

---

## Decision Framework

| If I see... | Then... |
|-------------|---------|
| Consistent PR reviews (2-3/week), blockers escalated, clear communication | Continue with regular check-ins, path to passing probation |
| Some improvement but still gaps | Weekly 1:1s with explicit targets, 2-week checkpoint |
| No material change | Begin exit conversation |
