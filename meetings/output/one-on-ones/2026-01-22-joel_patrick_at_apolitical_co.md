## 1. Futura Management Concerns (Priority)

### The Situation
Joel's message (Jan 20): *"We don't have an end-to-end version of Futura... I'm doing a deep dive on the product for the board [in March]. I interviewed our next potential CCO today and I had to show her a prototype I built rather than Futura itself."*

### Your Concerns

**1. No Clear Ownership on Delivery**
- The fact that this went out to two Staff Engineers, a Director, and a PM suggests no single person owns the end-to-end demo delivery
- Who is accountable for the March board presentation having a working product?

**2. Responses Perpetuate Mismanagement**
- Charles responded with tactical advice about V1 vs V2 components
- Lowell and Charles chatted about "low lift" changes like fonts and navigation
- Neither response addressed: *"What does end-to-end mean? Who owns it? What's the gap? What's the plan?"*

**3. You've Been at Arm's Length**
- You're only now seeing the urgency that's been building
- Been held back from delivery involvement for months
- Now being pulled in when it's a crisis

**4. Misaligned Work**
- Joel's emphasis: "How do we use AI to get devs delivering faster?"
- But the conversation pushed work (component tweaks, font changes) that doesn't yield an end-to-end demo
- The real need: define owner → tech inventory → gap analysis → ticketing → execution

### Suggested Framing
*"I want to help solve this, but I'm concerned about how we got here. The responses to your message were tactical when we need strategic. Before we throw more resources at this, we need:*
1. *A single owner accountable for the March demo*
2. *A clear definition of what 'end-to-end' means*
3. *A gap analysis against current state*
4. *A realistic plan with milestones"*

### Question to Ask
*"Who owns the Futura delivery outcome right now? Not who's contributing - who wakes up at night worried about the March board demo?"*

## 2. Charles Discussion Follow-up

### Context
- Earlier today: Agreed on £118k + grow direct reports in Q1, reassess if trajectory continues
- Joel has since read your talent review marking Charles as "developing" in some areas
- He may ask why

### Your Position

**The Results Speak**
- Charles is now performing significantly better than 6 months ago
- This improvement came from direct, sometimes tough conversations you've had with him
- The "developing" ratings reflect areas where growth was needed - and is happening

**Trust the Process**
- You're his manager. You're getting results.
- The tough conversations are working - he's responding to feedback
- Marking someone "developing" isn't a criticism - it's honest assessment that enables targeted growth

**Key Points if Challenged**
- "Developing" doesn't mean underperforming - it means room to grow
- The growth is visible in his recent contributions (UAE work, AI tooling, prototyping)
- Your management approach is calibrated to him - direct feedback, clear expectations
- Today's outcome (£118k + direct reports) reflects confidence in his trajectory

### Suggested Framing
*"I've had some direct conversations with Charles that weren't comfortable but were necessary. The result is a much stronger Staff Engineer. My talent review was honest about where he was developing - and he is developing. Trust that I'm managing him appropriately."*

## 3. Analytics Engineer Hiring

### Context
From RW Data Segmentation meeting (Jan 20):
- Rwanda cohort skewing all platform metrics
- Need to segment data by country, cohort, organisation
- Pete is at capacity with ARC dashboard and Academy modelling
- Yang suggested need for an analyst focused on engagement metrics

### The Question
Should we wait for the Data Lead to land (best case early Q2) before hiring an Analytics Engineer? Or pull the trigger now?

### Arguments for Hiring Now

1. **Immediate Need**
   - Ilana can't produce accurate reports with Rwanda skewing everything
   - Ethiopia partnership coming with similar challenges
   - Business decisions being made on corrupted data

2. **Data Lead Won't Solve This**
   - Data Lead is strategic/leadership role
   - Analytics Engineer is execution/delivery role
   - They're complementary, not sequential

3. **Capacity Crisis**
   - Pete stretched across ARC, Academy, general analytics
   - Yang focused on pipelines and infrastructure
   - No one to build the segmentation models Ilana needs

4. **Growing Backlog**
   - ThoughtSpot literacy across business
   - LinkedIn data integration if ads scale
   - SurveySparrow hitting limits, need platform surveys

### Arguments for Waiting

1. **Data Lead Should Shape the Role**
   - They'll have views on what's needed
   - Avoid hiring someone who doesn't fit their vision

2. **Q2 Isn't Far Away**
   - 6-8 weeks in best case
   - Can we manage with workarounds until then?

### Your Recommendation
*"I'd lean towards starting the search now. The Data Lead can influence the final hire, but we can't wait 2-3 months for them to land before even starting the process. The segmentation work is blocking business decisions today."*

## Meeting Approach

Joel is empathetic and collaborative. Frame concerns as shared problems to solve, not accusations. He'll respond well to:
- Direct honesty about what you're seeing
- Solutions-oriented framing
- Acknowledgment of the pressure he's under

Time is short (45 mins) - prioritise Futura, it's the most urgent. Charles and Analytics Engineer can be quicker discussions.

|-------|---------------|-----------------|
| Futura | Need clear ownership + structured approach | Single accountable owner identified |
